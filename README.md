# sw_sprint-1
we have 3 functions (LogIn, Register, GetAllUsers)
you should write the function in URL like that 

for getAllUsers ---> http://localhost:8084/webServices/webresources/admin/getAllUsers/(status)

for LogIN       ---> http://localhost:8084/webServices/webresources/users/login/(email/password)

for Register    ---> http://localhost:8084/webServices/webresources/account/register/(name/email/password/gender/address/nationality/status)

things between ( ) its an attribute of the function , you must remove () in URL
